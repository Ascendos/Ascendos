One of the biggest PITA issues with koji is the initial setup as it's a long
series of steps where a single typo can furstrate your efforts.
This directory contains a chain of shell scripts that can be used to
quickly setup a simple localized koji environment.

Recommendation:
	If you have the resources, I'd recommend working with a minimal vm
	at least to start with. (see virt-manager (kvm/xen/qemu))
	That way you can play around a bit without accidentally 'damaging'
	your system

Caveat: Assumes that postgres has no other databases being managed
	If you have databases on postgres, BACK THEM UP because this
	WILL destroy them

Step 1:
	change directory to the directory where the setup files are
	eg cd /export/setup

Step 2:
	*EDIT* the 'defaults' file
	a number of variables are automagically set but you may wish to
	override those with your own preferances

Step 3:
	run the 'makeworld' script from that directory

You may notice that some services are restarted a number of times, this is
because some scripts can be run standalone but need certain services to be
available when run outside of the makeworld script.

Adding new users after the fact
eg user 'joe'

cd /etc/pki/koji
openssl genrsa -out certs/joe.key 2048
openssl req -config /etc/pki/koji/ssl.cnf -new -nodes \
	-subj /C=US/ST=CA/O=Oracle/OU=OSS/CN=joe/emailAddress=joe@blackknight \
	-out certs/joe.csr -key certs/joe.key
openssl ca -config /etc/pki/koji/ssl.cnf \
	-subj /C=US/ST=CA/O=Oracle/OU=OSS/CN=joe/emailAddress=joe@blackknight \
	-keyfile private/koji_ca_cert.key -cert koji_ca_cert.crt \
	-outdir certs -out certs/joe.crt -infiles certs/joe.csr
openssl pkcs12 -export -password pass: -inkey certs/joe.key -in certs/joe.crt \
	-CAfile koji_ca_cert.crt -out certs/joe_browser_cert.p12
koji add-user joe

copy/tarball up koji_ca_cert.crt, joe.pem, joe_browser_cert.p12 and
/etc/koji.conf (as 'config') making sure to change the "cert = " line
to joe.pem and have your user install it all under the directory .koji in
their home directory
ie
	[joe@blackknight /tmp]# ls  ~/.koji
	config  joe_browser_cert.p12  koji_ca_cert.crt  joe.pem

For firefox, the joe_browser_cert.p12 file can be imported through
	Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Encryption -> View Certificates
	-> Your Certificates -> Import
Type in the location of the .p12 file
There is no password set on the .p12 file so just press ok
After Firefox imports the .p12 file you should be able to access the koji
webpage and use the login link in the top right
