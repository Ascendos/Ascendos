RHEL6 wasn't build on RHEL6, except for a few last packages.  In order to get the most compatability, it is best to rebuild the source rpm's on the distribution RHEL build their packages on.
There were four main build platforms.  Fedora 12, Fedora 13, RHEL6 Beta, and RHEL6.  

The files here list which packages (from the original source rpm's of the final RHEL6.0) need to get build on which targets.


Fedora 12 - f12.txt
Fedora 13 - f13.txt
RHEL6 Beta - rh6beta.txt
RHEL 6.0 - rh60.txt
