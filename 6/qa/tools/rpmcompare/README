rpmcompare.sh
This compares two similarly named rpms.  This is good to make sure they are compatable.

To find out all the options, use the -h option

The most common options are -c and -r.  These are used for the directories to compare.
Examples:
  sh rpmcompare.sh -c /tmp/original/ -r /tmp/rebuilt/

The results will show up in the directory rpmcompareresults unless to change that option.
