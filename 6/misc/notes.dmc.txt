current activities
==================

done: added list of information taps to wiki, which are becoming
      better sources of information than this file

first alpha
-----------
rc's are in the pipeline from el-build, now even with inital live spin.
Presently seeking better consensus and documentation on mirror/output
layout.  Issue being pursued on -dev,wiki,bugzilla.  Note, being so
close to 6.1 package completeness, that is now a blocker for the next
real alpha rc.

upcoming beta tasks
-------------------
need to handle the 6.0 package off-spec release naming issues, and the 
~200? 6.1 packages that need being built.  The 2 oldest unbuilt packages
(grub and qt) have been built.  The next batches require some abbreviated
manual steps (for the .asc ones), along with leveraging present gen-tdv
automation.  And several require dispatch logic that should simultaenously
be encoded into v-bake or preferably newly factored subcommand.  Beyond
that, everything may just build, with the dozen(?) or so of the remaining
updates that require the semi-manual import (to be automated, e.g. the
quintessential httpd default test page branding example.


build3
------
goal: recreating build.ascendos.org contents in a more automated way
i.e. koji and its output.

(prior build2 run went to ~1950)
current status: ~300/~2800
current state: suspended while focusing on 6.1-alpha-rc3, and also new
anonymous testing person w/hardware resource (3 beefy systems) Andrew
introduced me to.  Formalized test/help procedures will be drafted, though
the first phase would boil down to familiarizing yourself with the
existing documentation, and figuring out how to blow that 100G bandwidth
from your ISP.  As that is a one time up front thing that will likely 
take a couple or more days anyway.

todo: need to add pxe live image serving configuration such that
any willing builder nodes on the local net are utilized


maintenance process
-------------------
need to start documenting candidate mainenance workflows, preferably with dia

- note, ran across old post from Troy about his rpmcomparing to SL6, somewhat
  contradicting how I responded to someone about what rpmcompare was used against
  by us.  Though I presume Troy's longterm intent was to rpmcompare against tuv, or
  at the least centos and similar, and not focus on the results against SL6.  
  BUT, the point is that such a phase against at least SL6 seems worth doing and
  encoding at the very least as a non?default option for the el-build user. 


build.a.o/linux/ascendos
------------------------

2011-10-05: added /GPG/RPM-GPG-KEY-ascendos-alpha-dmc
2011-10-05: repochange: added zsh, libxml2, perl-Sys-Virt, and XXXXXX-logos(containing our branding) to 6.0/SRPMS/ 

- koji: new ascendos-release
- koji: new X-logos
- koji: new zsh (related to above, in see bz#...)

-------------

2011-10-26: removed off-off-spec obsoleted

misc todo
---------
- need to go through and clean quiet/verbose/debug functionality,
  perhaps even an eval wrapper, such that complex, and even simple
  commands like view-last-bake-vm have less chaotic terminal output
  (except when requested)
- need to revisit initial import process, as there has been a lot of
  code churn that has no doubt broken those scripts.  Use diffing sl
  and centos as dev/test cases if possible
