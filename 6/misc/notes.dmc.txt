current activities
==================

first installable release
-------------------------
a 6.0/dogfood1/rc1 tree is complete with netinst and DVD installable
isos generated with f13 pungi on an sl60 base.  see notes in the
makeAscendos-6.0 script/outline.  For right now we need a first alpha
or prealpha release criteria/qa-script for the release to pass before
we make it public.

bugzilla
--------
we need a bugzilla instance.  known bugs-

- SL ref in redhat logos COPYING file
- SL ref in yum repo config
- gnome menubar logo needs some padding
- need a better index.html ff-startpage
- Andrew and I have both noticed on my dogfood1rc1 release that
  the wired network started offline, requiring a single initial
  click to get it online.  (theoretically TUV behaviour? bug?)

git
---
getting a more unified and long term structured git repo in place

wiki
----
getting all needed information onto the wiki.  Notes on an initial
proposed structure are in an email to ascendos-dev and just need to
be implemented as a first pass

build2
------
being able to recreate everything that was on build.ascendos.org when
Troy left and I started as lead developer, i.e. koji and its output.
I got through something like ~1950/2017 of the 6.0 package builds that
could build without problem against an sl60 buildroot.  The remaining
packages are from the troubledpackage list on the wiki and need some
special, but not complex handling. The vm build2.ascendos.org had to
be freed due to resource constraint, but I'll get the project finished
on my local k/vm at home.  Then take everything I did and script it
fold it into the makeAscendos-6.0 script

maintenance process
-------------------
need to go over the rest of Troy's buildscripts and get them entirely
centrally documented.  I.e. combine that with the 15 item workflow
that Troy posted to ascendos-dev awhile back.  Ideally converting that
workflow into a visual flowchart with the dia tool.  Then start 
planning for how to distribute the maintenance workload amongst devs.
I.e. time shifts for responsibility for handling incoming updates, as
there will no doubt be a final human action to release a new update
into the public repos

mirrors
-------
Andrew is really handling this right now, but I may hit up my alma
matter for another mirror.  I could probably even do a mirror myself
on my $10/mo 1and1.com account.  Might be worthwhile.

other stuff
-----------
I'm sure I've left some stuff out, I've got a lot of notes, many posted
to -dev that I need to get put into the right structure in git/wiki.
