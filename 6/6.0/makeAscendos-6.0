# This is a placeholder for the timebeing.  
#
# phase1: this script should take as input an online or offline set of Ascendos-6.0 binary
#         rpms, and output a complete installable 6.0 distribution.  This will involve
#         using pungi and mock to generate the output.
#
# phase2: include wrapper logic that uses virt-install to create a build vm for the 
#         above, in a 100% reproducible fashion.  I.e. an SL60 VM specified by a 
#         kickstart configuration that will reside alongside this script.
#
# phase3: add an additional initial phase that does everything that the makeworld
#         script does to setup koji, then issues the necessary koji commands to 
#         transform the input of a set of Ascendos .src.rpms, into the binary set
#         that was previously used as initial input.
#
# phase4: add an additional initial phase that generates that set of .src.rpm input
#         from a minimal set of deltas from upstream packages, along with access to 
#         either a local or remote copy of those upstream packages.  With either 
#         hashing or gpg signature checking of those incoming upstream packages, against
#         either a local set of checksums or a local copy of TUV public key.
