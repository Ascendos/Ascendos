========================================================================

This is a the Ascendos development tree.  From its small (<30MB) set
of scripts and deltas, you can (in the future easily) rebuild the entire
Ascendos binary enterprise linux distribution.

The general structure at the moment should be fairly self explanatory-

------------------------------------------------------------------------
./Ascendos

tree root

------------------------------------------------------------------------
./Ascendos/tools

various build tools.  ./Ascendos/tools/bin/el-build is the central
tool which refers to subcommands defined at present primarily under
/tools/scripts/.  See ./Ascendos/docs/README.scripts for the current
best in-tree documentation on those.  For more information, please
explore our website, especially the wiki, and the development
mailinglist archives, and of course the code and git commit comments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
./Ascendos/6

area for things specific to our *el6 versions

------------------------------------------------------------------------
./Ascendos/6/build

primarily koji setup scripts

------------------------------------------------------------------------
./Ascendos/6/qa

primarily the rpmcompare.sh tool

------------------------------------------------------------------------
./Ascendos/6/6.0
./Ascendos/6/6.0/configs

generally the configuration files used to generate our forthcoming 6.0
release.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
./Ascendos/6/docs

documentation related to our *el6 release

========================================================================

Nothing is set in stone right now.  Comments and suggestions for the
most efficient and intuitive tree layout are encouraged.

Ascendos project.

historical notes:

The tree includes the contents of the the two prior git trees that
Troy Dawson first started, namely koji-setup-scripts and
checking-packages-scripts.  It also initially imports other scripts
that Troy had in his tree on build.ascendos.org when he left but hadn't
yet put in git.  Namely the koji-setup-scripts/buildscripts subdirectory
which now lives under ascendos/6/build/koji-setup-scripts/buildscripts.
That dir had also included both rpmcompare.sh and some rpmcompare output
runs from about a month before he left.  Those files are now under
ascendos/6/qa/ along with all the prior contents of the
checking-packages-scripts tree.
