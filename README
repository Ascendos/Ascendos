This is a first pass at a new unified Ascendos development tree.  It
unifies the the two prior git trees that Troy Dawson first started, 
namely koji-setup-scripts and checking-packages-scripts.  It also
initially imports other scripts that Troy had in his tree on
build.ascendos.org when he left but hadn't yet put in git.  Namely the
koji-setup-scripts/buildscripts subdirectory which now lives under
ascendos/6/build/koji-setup-scripts/buildscripts.  That dir had also
included both rpmcompare.sh and some rpmcompare output runs from about
a month before he left.  Those files are now under ascendos/6/qa/ along
with all the prior contents of the checking-packages-scripts tree.

The general structure at the moment should be fairly self explanatory-

./ascendos
./ascendos/6
./ascendos/6/misc
./ascendos/6/build
./ascendos/6/build/koji-setup-scripts
./ascendos/6/build/koji-setup-scripts/files
./ascendos/6/build/koji-setup-scripts/buildscripts
./ascendos/6/build/koji-setup-scripts/buildscripts/sl6
./ascendos/6/build/koji-setup-scripts/buildscripts/archive
./ascendos/6/qa
./ascendos/6/qa/tools
./ascendos/6/qa/tools/rpmcompare
./ascendos/6/qa/reports
./ascendos/6/qa/reports/pre-2011-08-03
./ascendos/6/6.0
./ascendos/6/6.0/configs
./ascendos/6/6.1
./ascendos/6/docs

Nothing is set in stone right now.  Comments and suggestions for the
most efficient and intuitive tree layout are encouraged.
